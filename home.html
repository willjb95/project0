                    The purpose of Eco Electronics it to create a cleaner environment by reusing, repairing and recycling 
                    electronics that would usually get thrown in to landfills. But by doing this we not only help the 
                    environment we actually help the people by providing access to electronics via charities, colleges, 
                    universities to help educate and provide the benefits of technology.

                    Most people think that when electronics break, become outdated or have been used more than they would 
                    like the only option is to throw them in the bin or recycle them. But on the contrary, there are a number of 
                    ways to transform non-functioning technology into new, usable products. After all, reusing is even more earth-friendly 
                    than recycling.

                        <li>Don’t trash them: First, we should never throw e-waste in the trash! Even the small stuff like phones or batteries shouldn’t 
                            go in the trash. There are some toxic (dangerous) chemicals in these products that don’t belong in the trash. It’s bad for our 
                            environment, plus it means throwing away valuable metals that can be recycled. </li>
                        <li>Pas them on for reuse: Sometimes you have something that still works, but you don’t use it any more. But somebody else might 
                            use it.  The best thing to do is to give it to someone else who can keep using it. If you 
                            don’t find a family member or friend who wants it, you can often donate it to a charity in your community.</li>                           
                        <li>Recycle them:  If you can’t find someone who wants to use your old gadget, then you can recycle it.  You probably already recycle 
                            newspapers or bottles or cans from your house. Electronics can be recycled, too.</li>
