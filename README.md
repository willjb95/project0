# Project 0

This project invloves me creating my ownwebsite using a variety of different languages and tools including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4. What I have chosen to base my website on is the resuse, repair and recyling of electronic goods, after researching this area I found that there is far too much electronics just getting thrown to the bins and send to landfills which is affecting the environment and workers around those sites. This website is to build awarness about this issue and what we can all do to help.
